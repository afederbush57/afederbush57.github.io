<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>

<p> Hey! My name is Alex Federbush and I'm currently enrolled as a freshman in the McCombs School of business. In my free time, I enjoy relaxing with my friends, being outdoors and traveling this beautiful country. I anticipate being a Finance major with a minor in Accounting.
